"""
There are a number of grades you can get in a test: A, B, C, D, F.
The percentages are as follows:

A: 90-100%

B: 80-90%

C: 70-80%

D: 60-70%

F: <60%

Determine the grade that a student will get based on the student's score and the maximum score.
Note that the upper limit is not included in the range,
except for the A grade. For example,
a student with 60% will get D, with 70% or 79.9% â€” C,
but the top score 100% is just A.
The input format:
Two lines: the first with a student's score and the second with the maximum.
The output format:
The grade of the student.
